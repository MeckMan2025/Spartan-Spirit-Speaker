1. One-Page Product Brief

Spartan Spirit Speaker – Pleasant Valley High School

Project Overview
The Spartan Spirit Speaker is a student-designed, student-built collectible Bluetooth speaker created by Pleasant Valley High School’s Robotics Team and Band program. Each year, students design a new limited-run Spartan helmet speaker that plays the PV fight song and other school-approved audio. Sales of the speaker directly support student clubs, performing arts, and STEM activities at Pleasant Valley.

Purpose & Goals
	•	Fundrasing while giving the community a tangible symbol of school pride.
	•	Provide real-world experience in design, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and business.
	•	Build a long-term “collectible series” that families, alumni, and fans can look forward to each year.

Product Description
	•	Custom Spartan helmet speaker in PV colors and branding.
	•	Plays the Pleasant Valley fight song.
	•	Designed, prototyped, and manufactured by PV students using modern tools (3D modeling, 3D printing/CNC, electronics).
	•	Limited annual edition – design refreshed every school year to reflect the creativity of that student cohort (“collect them all”).

Student Learning Outcomes

Students participate in the complete product lifecycle:
	•	Concept & Design – market research, concept sketches, CAD/3D modeling, design reviews.
	•	Engineering & Electronics – prototyping, audio hardware selection, wiring, testing.
	•	Manufacturing – print/production planning, quality checks, assembly workflows.
	•	Branding & Marketing – naming, logo/packaging, website content, social posts, sales copy.
	•	Sales & Order Management – pre-order windows, demand planning, customer communication.
	•	Operations & Business – budgeting, cost analysis, margin planning, fundraising reporting.

Fundraising Model
	•	Speakers are sold in time-boxed ordering windows.
	•	Once production capacity is filled, that window closes (creating real-world constraints and urgency).
	•	Net proceeds support student activities.

Target Customers
	•	PV parents and families
	•	PV alumni, community supporters, and boosters
	•	Students who want a unique piece of Spartan memorabilia

Key Differentiators
	•	100% student-run design and production process
	•	Annual limited-edition design – no two years are the same
	•	Combines school spirit, music, and STEM into one collectible product
	•	Local, tangible impact: every purchase supports PV students directly

Call to Action
	•	Primary: “Sign up to be notified when the next ordering window opens.”
	•	Secondary (when live): “Pre-order your Spartan Spirit Speaker now – limited quantities available.”
